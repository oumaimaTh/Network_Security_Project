# Network_Security_Project
Internship project

The topic of my internship was creating a secure network architecture. This architecture includes various critical elements such as Cisco routers and switches, Fortinet firewalls, Windows servers, and a BigIP WAF. The WAF constitutes the heart of the project, because it is essential for filtering and securing web traffic. The objective was to ensure optimal protection against online threats while guaranteeing the availability and integrity of web services.
